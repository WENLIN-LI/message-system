# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

Message System — a real-time AI collaboration platform with shared chat rooms and sandboxed code-agent workspaces. The repo contains a React client (`client-heroui/`), a Node.js control plane (`server/src/`), and a Python JSONL runner/daemon (`server/message-system_code_agent_runner/`) packaged into pinned E2B artifacts.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start everything (builds server, then launches both)
./start.sh

# Server (Express + Socket.IO, port 3012)
cd server && npm run dev          # ts-node-dev hot reload
cd server && npm run build        # tsc → dist/
cd server && npm start            # run compiled dist/src/server.js
cd server && npm test             # Node built-in test runner (src/**/*.test.ts)

# Client (React + Vite, port 3011)
cd client-heroui && npm run dev   # Vite dev server
cd client-heroui && npm run build # i18n check + tsc + vite build
cd client-heroui && npm run lint  # ESLint
cd client-heroui && npm test      # Vitest

# E2E (Playwright)
cd client-heroui && npm run test:e2e
cd client-heroui && npm run test:e2e:postgres   # against PostgreSQL store

# i18n
cd client-heroui && npm run check:i18n          # verify all keys present
cd client-heroui && npm run translate:i18n:dry   # preview auto-translations
cd client-heroui && npm run translate:i18n       # apply auto-translations

# Persistence smoke test (uses local Redis DB 15, never prod)
cd server && npm run smoke:persistence
cd server && TEST_DATABASE_URL="postgres://localhost/message_system_test" npm run smoke:persistence
```

## Architecture

### Persistence: Dual-Store Pattern

The server uses a `CompositeRoomStore` (`server/src/repositories/store.ts`) that combines:

- **DurableRoomStore** — either `RedisStore` or `PostgresStore`, selected by `PERSISTENCE_STORE` env var (`redis` default, or `postgres`). Owns rooms, messages, members, media assets, auth, push subscriptions.
- **RealtimeRoomStore** — always Redis. Manages online presence, socket sessions, ephemeral member counts.
- **RoomMessageCacheStore** (optional) — Redis TTL cache in front of PostgreSQL reads, invalidated on writes.

The `CompositeRoomStore` delegates every method to the right sub-store and handles cache invalidation automatically. When adding new store operations, add the method to the `DurableRoomStore` interface, implement in both `RedisStore` and `PostgresStore`, then proxy through `CompositeRoomStore`.

### Socket Event Handlers

Socket handlers are split by domain in `server/src/socket/`:
- `roomHandlers.ts` — create/join/leave rooms, member management, room settings
- `messageHandlers.ts` — send/edit/delete messages, message history, reactions
- `aiHandlers.ts` — AI streaming (`ask_ai`), model selection, role drafts
- `codeAgentWorkspaceHandlers.ts` — authenticated sandbox snapshots, files/diffs, PTY terminal, preview sessions, and workspace mutations
- `transcriptionHandlers.ts` — audio transcription via AssemblyAI

All registered in `registerSocketHandlers.ts`, sharing a `SocketHandlerDeps` context.

### Server Services

- `aiModels.ts` — model registry, normalization, model options from env
- `aiClients.ts` — OpenRouter/direct API client factory
- `aiStreamRecovery.ts` — marks interrupted streaming messages as failed on startup
- `mediaObjectStorage.ts` — S3-compatible object storage (Tigris in prod), presigned URLs
- `clientAuth.ts` — password hashing, token-based auth
- `googleAuth.ts` — Google OAuth credential verification
- `pushNotifications.ts` — web-push notifications
- `messageDomain.ts` — message construction helpers, reply references

### Client Structure

Single-page app with one route (`/`). `MessagePage` is the main orchestrator handling room state, socket events, and view switching. Key layers:

- **Views**: `WelcomeView` (room list), `ChatRoomView` (chat), `SettingsView`, `SavedRoomList`
- **Socket**: `utils/socket.ts` — singleton connection, all emit/on wrappers
- **State**: `utils/roomState.ts`, `utils/messageState.ts`, `utils/appPersistence.ts` — localStorage-backed state
- **Hooks**: `useRoomMessageEvents` (message sync), `useAIRoles`, `useStickers`, `useCachedMedia`
- **i18n**: `utils/i18n.ts` + `utils/languages.ts` — en/zh/hi/ja/ko translations, browser language detection

Desktop uses a sidebar layout (`DesktopSidebar`); mobile uses bottom navigation (`BottomNav`). Breakpoint at 768px.

### Media Pipeline

Upload: client requests presigned URL → uploads to S3/Tigris or local media storage → confirms to server → server creates a `MediaAsset` record. Download: server generates signed read URLs on demand. Legacy base64 image cleanup is available through `npm run migrate:media-to-object-storage`; it defaults to dry-run and requires `--execute` plus a verified backup file before uploading objects or updating PostgreSQL.

### AI Streaming

Client sends `ask_ai` socket event with role/model/context. Server selects the configured provider client (DeepSeek, Anthropic, OpenAI, or OpenRouter), streams chunks as `ai_chunk`, and ends with `ai_stream_end`. Messages have `status: 'streaming' | 'complete' | 'error'`. On server restart, `aiStreamRecovery` marks orphaned streaming messages as failed.

### Code-Agent Runtime

Code-agent rooms are a separate request path from ordinary chat. Message System is the control plane; untrusted files, commands, terminals, and agent backends run in one room-scoped E2B sandbox.

- `codeAgentSessionService.ts` validates room access/mode/backend, persists durable turns, issues scoped credentials, streams ordered runner events, handles queue/steer/interrupt/approval controls, and saves backend session IDs.
- `codeAgentSandboxLifecycle.ts` creates or reconnects sandboxes, applies active/idle TTLs, recovers stale states, and migrates workspaces across pinned artifact upgrades.
- `codeAgentDaemonRegistry.ts` serializes one reusable JSONL daemon per sandbox and reclaims daemons on shutdown.
- `codeAgentRoomContext.ts` + `codeAgentRoomContextRoutes.ts` expose bounded room history/search/message/site reads through a turn-scoped sandbox broker and `message-system` CLI.
- `codeAgentModelGateway.ts` proxies only the selected provider/model with turn-scoped tokens, budgets, and usage accounting; provider keys never reach the browser.
- `codexConnection.ts` + `codexConnectionRoutes.ts` let each client connect their own Codex subscription through device authorization; Message System encrypts the auth material and injects it as a per-run sandbox secret. Coco remains the in-house CLI coding agent/engine.
- `publishedStaticSite.ts` stores room-owned versioned static artifacts in local/S3-compatible object storage and serves stable `/p/:slug/` URLs.
- `e2bCodeAgentSandboxService.ts` owns workspace files, Git changes/diffs/refs, PTY sessions, preview targets, archive migration, and sandbox SDK operations.

The browser workspace includes files/search/editing, asset previews, Git diff/review comments, a streamed PTY terminal, dev-server/browser previews, and published artifacts. The current architecture and ownership boundaries are documented in `docs/code-agent-runtime-architecture.md`.

## Deployment

`master` is the release branch. CI/CD (`.github/workflows/fly-deploy.yml`) runs on its schedule or through manual dispatch; it builds server + client, checks translations, verifies Fly secrets, and deploys to Fly.io. A push alone does not immediately trigger this workflow. When an immediate production rollout is required, dispatch the workflow after pushing and verify both the workflow result and Fly health. Never run `fly deploy` manually.

Production: Fly.io app `message-system` in `dfw` region, Node 24.18.0 Alpine, 512MB VM. PostgreSQL on Supabase, Redis on Upstash, media on Tigris (S3-compatible), and per-room execution sandboxes on E2B.

### Code Agent / E2B Artifact Rule

Production code-agent rooms run from a pinned E2B sandbox artifact, not directly from the deployed Node app source or a local code-agent engine checkout. Any change to `server/message-system_code_agent_runner`, runner tools, runner system prompts, the sandbox Dockerfile, or files copied by `scripts/code-agent/prepare-sandbox-context.mjs` must bump `ops/code-agent-sandbox/artifact.lock.json` and `ops/code-agent-sandbox/Dockerfile`, rebuild the E2B template, update `CODE_AGENT_E2B_TEMPLATE_ID` / `CODE_AGENT_ARTIFACT_VERSION`, and verify with an E2B smoke or direct runner check. Any code-agent engine change in `/Users/sky/projects/code-agent-engine` must first be committed and pushed there, then Message System must update `ops/code-agent-sandbox/artifact.lock.json` `codeAgentEngine.sourceRef` and production `CODE_AGENT_SOURCE_REF`, rebuild the E2B template, and verify it. Otherwise production sandboxes will keep using the old runner or old code-agent engine even after app deploys.

### Codex Backend Direction

`codex-app-server` is the supported Codex backend and the target for all new features, fixes, protocol work, and production behavior. The `codex` backend and `message-system_code_agent_runner.codex_cli` are deprecated legacy compatibility paths. Keep them only while existing data or explicit migration work still requires them; do not add new product capabilities, UI behavior, or architecture to the Codex CLI path. Shared code must follow app-server semantics and must not reintroduce CLI-era constraints such as a client-wide turn lock.

### Task Completion and Push Rule

After completing any task, run both production builds (`cd server && npm run build` and `cd client-heroui && npm run build`) plus any focused tests needed for the change. Then commit the completed work and push it directly to `origin/master`; when working from a detached HEAD, use `git push origin HEAD:master`. Confirm that local `HEAD` and `origin/master` resolve to the same commit. Do not leave completed, validated changes only in the local worktree.

Before the final push, check whether the change falls under the E2B artifact rule above. If it does, the task is not complete until the E2B template and artifact pins are updated, the new template is built and verified, and production is pointed at the matching E2B version. Finish with all source, lockfile, Dockerfile, and production pin changes committed and pushed to `origin/master`.

## Coding Conventions

- TypeScript, two-space indent, no semicolons in some newer files (inconsistent — match the file you're editing)
- React components: PascalCase files (`MessageInput.tsx`), functional components, HeroUI + Tailwind
- Hooks: `useThing.ts`
- Tests colocated: `Thing.test.tsx` / `thing.test.ts`
- Client ESLint enforces React hook rules; prefix unused params with `_`
- Commits: short present-tense subjects, prefixed (`fix:`, `stickers:`, etc.)
- Codebase has Chinese comments throughout — this is intentional, keep the language of existing comments when editing nearby code
