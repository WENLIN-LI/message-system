# Image Object Storage Migration Runbook

This runbook covers the one-time migration from legacy base64 image messages in PostgreSQL to private Tigris/S3 object storage.

## Decision

Run the migration from a local workstation or a dedicated migration host, not from the serving Fly app VM.

The serving Fly VM is sized for the web process. A migration process that reads image payloads and runs `sharp` conversion competes with the live Node server for memory and CPU. The migration script now refuses to run on a Fly app VM by default.

If a dedicated non-serving Fly migration machine is intentionally provisioned, set `ALLOW_FLY_APP_VM_IMAGE_MIGRATION=true` for that machine only. Do not set it on the serving app VM.

The migration still converts legacy images to lossless WebP with `sharp`. The objective is:

- remove large base64 payloads from `room_messages.content`;
- store image bytes in private object storage;
- keep only asset metadata in PostgreSQL;
- preserve visual quality during this one-time cleanup.

## Prerequisites

- A verified PostgreSQL backup exists before execute mode.
- Local environment can reach the production PostgreSQL database.
- Local environment has Tigris/S3 credentials for the private image bucket.
- The deployed server already supports asset-backed image messages and signed read URLs.

Required environment variables:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgres://..."
POSTGRES_SSL="true"
IMAGE_BUCKET_NAME="message-system-images"
IMAGE_STORAGE_REGION="auto"
IMAGE_STORAGE_ENDPOINT="https://fly.storage.tigris.dev"
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="..."
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="..."
MESSAGE_SYSTEM_DB_BACKUP_FILE="/absolute/path/to/verified-backup.dump"
```

Do not commit these values.

## Dry Run

Run from the local `server` directory:

```bash
cd server
npm run build
node dist/src/scripts/migrateImageMessagesToObjectStorage.js --room-id=<ROOM_ID>
```

Dry-run reads the selected room, decodes legacy image payloads, converts them to WebP in memory, and reports stats. It does not upload objects or update PostgreSQL.

For all rooms, omit `--room-id`.

## Execute

Start with the room that has known legacy image payloads:

```bash
cd server
node dist/src/scripts/migrateImageMessagesToObjectStorage.js \
  --execute \
  --room-id=<ROOM_ID> \
  --backup-file="$MESSAGE_SYSTEM_DB_BACKUP_FILE"
```

The script is idempotent:

- messages that already have an image asset are skipped;
- uploaded objects are deleted best-effort if PostgreSQL replacement fails;
- repeated runs should not duplicate message rows or image assets.

## Verification

Before migration, the target room should show legacy image payloads:

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE m.message_type = 'image') AS image_messages,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE m.message_type = 'image' AND a.id IS NULL) AS legacy_images,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE m.message_type = 'image' AND a.id IS NOT NULL) AS asset_images,
  COALESCE(SUM(length(m.content)) FILTER (WHERE m.message_type = 'image' AND a.id IS NULL), 0) AS legacy_content_bytes
FROM room_messages m
LEFT JOIN image_assets a ON a.message_id = m.id
WHERE m.room_id = '<ROOM_ID>';
```

After migration:

- `legacy_images` should be `0`;
- `asset_images` should match the previous image count;
- `legacy_content_bytes` should be near `0`;
- `image_assets` should contain one row per migrated image message;
- room history loading should no longer transfer base64 image payloads.

## Rollback

The database backup is the rollback source of truth. If execute mode partially fails, rerun after fixing the issue; the script skips already asset-backed messages. If a completed migration must be undone, restore the verified backup and delete orphaned objects from the bucket.
