# Media Viewer Gesture Requirements

## Goal

The image and video viewer should feel closer to a native photo viewer than a web carousel. Gesture decisions must be predictable, reversible while the finger is still down, and committed only when the gesture ends.

## Scope

- Full-screen media viewer opened from a chat message.
- Single media preview opened from the image/video history grid.
- Image gestures: double-tap zoom, pinch zoom, pan, tap return, swipe down return, horizontal media navigation.
- Video behavior: no autoplay; playback starts only from explicit user action.

## Interaction Rules

### Gesture commit timing

- No navigation, close, or return action may execute on pointer down or pointer move.
- Pointer move may only update visual preview state, such as carousel offset, vertical dismiss offset, image pan, or pinch scale.
- Navigation, close, and return are committed only on pointer up or pointer cancel.
- If a gesture does not pass the commit threshold, the viewer returns to its prior visual state.

### Tap and double tap

- A tap is a pointer sequence with movement no greater than 8 px.
- Single tap returns from the current preview:
  - In the main viewer, single tap closes the viewer.
  - In history single-preview mode, single tap returns to the history grid.
- Single tap must be delayed briefly so a second tap can convert it into a double tap.
- Double tap on an image toggles zoom:
  - If the image is at 1x, zoom to 2x.
  - If the image is above 1x, return to 1x.
  - The second tap position is the zoom anchor, so the tapped point stays as close as possible to the same screen location.
- Tap and double tap do not apply to videos; video taps are left to native controls, while drag gestures on the video surface may still navigate or dismiss.

### Pinch zoom

- Two active pointers on an image enter pinch mode.
- Pinch scale is continuous and calculated from pointer distance.
- The pinch center is the anchor, so the content under the midpoint remains stable as much as possible.
- Pinch disables horizontal navigation and vertical return until all but one pointer has ended.
- Zoom is clamped to 1x through 6x.
- If pinch ends close to 1x, snap back to exactly 1x and recenter.

### Image pan

- At zoom greater than 1x, one-finger movement pans the image unless the gesture direction locks as a downward return.
- Pan is clamped so the image cannot drift indefinitely away from the viewport.
- Pan is committed visually during move, but no navigation or return is committed until pointer up.

### Horizontal navigation

- Horizontal swiping is active only at 1x for images, and remains active on video surfaces.
- Movement locks to horizontal once horizontal displacement exceeds the gesture threshold and dominates vertical movement.
- While dragging, the carousel follows the finger using direct DOM transforms instead of React state updates, with transform writes batched through `requestAnimationFrame`.
- React state should update only after pointer up selects a new item or resets the current one.
- Release animation duration should be calculated from remaining travel distance and release velocity, then clamped to a bounded native-feeling 500ms-800ms range.
- Commit criteria:
  - Swipe distance exceeds the distance threshold, or
  - Swipe velocity exceeds the velocity threshold.
- If neither threshold is met, the carousel snaps back.
- At first/last media, horizontal drag applies edge resistance instead of hard-stopping.

### Downward return

- Downward return is active at both 1x and zoomed states.
- It locks when downward displacement exceeds the gesture threshold and dominates horizontal movement.
- During move, the active media follows the finger downward, scales down, and the backdrop plus viewer chrome fade with the gesture.
- It returns only on pointer up if distance or velocity threshold is met.
- If the threshold is not met, the viewer springs back to normal.

### Gesture priority

1. Interactive controls: buttons, links, and video controls keep their native behavior.
2. Two active pointers: pinch.
3. Single pointer on image:
   - If zoomed and downward movement dominates, vertical return.
   - If zoomed and not downward return, image pan.
   - If 1x and horizontal movement dominates, horizontal navigation.
   - If 1x and downward movement dominates, vertical return.
4. Tap candidate:
   - Single tap returns after the double-tap delay.
   - Double tap toggles image zoom at the tapped position.

## Video Requirements

- Full-viewer videos must not autoplay when opened or when swiped into view.
- Full-viewer videos must show native controls when active.
- Full-viewer videos must allow horizontal swipe navigation when dragging on the video surface.
- Leaving a video slide should not attempt to keep it playing.

## Performance Requirements

- Pointer move must not call React state setters for every frame of horizontal drag or vertical dismiss preview.
- Pointer move should avoid repeated expensive layout work; dimensions used for commit thresholds should be captured at gesture start.
- Gesture transforms should be applied outside React render during active movement and flushed once per animation frame, with CSS transitions disabled while following the finger.
- React state is updated after gesture completion for active media index, zoom, and pan.
- CSS transitions are disabled during direct finger tracking and enabled only for snap-back or commit animations.

## Accessibility Requirements

- Existing close, download, history, share, previous, and next buttons remain accessible by label.
- Keyboard left/right navigation remains available.
- Escape continues to close or return according to current mode.
- Images keep alt text.
- Motion is short and functional, not decorative.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Double-tapping an image zooms around the tap position; double-tapping again resets to 1x.
- Pinching an image changes zoom continuously and clamps between 1x and 6x.
- Single tapping an image closes the main viewer or returns from history preview, including when zoomed.
- Down swiping previews the return during movement and commits only after release.
- Horizontal swiping feels smooth and follows the finger at 1x.
- Horizontal swiping does not trigger while an image is zoomed.
- Closing after swiping to another item and reopening the original chat media starts from the clicked media, not the previous internal carousel position.
- Video slides do not autoplay and require explicit user play.
- Existing history preview action buttons remain available.

## Implementation Status

Current implementation lives in `client-heroui/src/components/MediaViewerModal.tsx`.
It covers direct DOM transforms, double-tap image zoom, pinch/pan/down-dismiss,
horizontal paging, video controls with no autoplay, inactive-video pause,
keyboard navigation, and Escape handling.

Automated coverage currently includes double-click zoom, tap close, downward
dismiss, horizontal image/video swipes, reopen behavior, and video no-autoplay
through `MessageItem.test.tsx`.

Known test gaps:

- Direct multi-pointer pinch simulation.
- Suppression of horizontal navigation while a zoomed image is panned.
- Edge resistance at the first/last media item.
- Velocity-only commits independent of distance.
- Keyboard arrow and Escape behavior.
- Single-tap delay before double-tap disambiguation.
